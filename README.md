# House Price Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains the code and dataset for predicting house prices. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of a house based on various features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about different houses in a particular area. Each row in the dataset represents a house and contains features such as the number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, total area, location, etc.

## Files
- `data.csv`: This is the dataset file which contains all the data about the houses.
- `preprocessing.py`: This script is used for preprocessing the data.
- `model.py`: This script is used to train the machine learning model.
- `predict.py`: This script is used to make predictions using the trained model.

## Setup & Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run `preprocessing.py` to preprocess the data.
4. Run `model.py` to train the model.
5. Use `predict.py` to make predictions.

## Usage
To predict the price of a house, run:
```
python predict.py --input_data <house_data.csv>
```
